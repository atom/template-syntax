# Atom Template Syntax Theme

This is a template syntax theme. Its goal is to be an example or template for
you to build from. See the less files in the `stylesheets` directory.

Feel free to fork this and create your own atom themes.

### Notes and best practices

* Name your syntax theme with `-syntax` at the end
* Define proper colors in your `syntax-variables.less` file. Other packages
  can use these variables. All the variables defined in this package's
  `syntax-variables.less` file must be defined &mdash; you cannot pick and choose.
* Always have a high-quality screenshot in the README
* The `colors.less` file is not necessary, but it's good practice.
